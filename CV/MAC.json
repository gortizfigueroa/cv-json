I enjoy being up to date so I am constantly learning.\n\nI like having a broad overview of what I'm doing, which has taken me to architectural and management positions. I don't have a strong preference for any specific stack, as long as it's the adequate for the needs. I enjoy making things happen and sharpening the future.\n\nCurrently I am the Chief Technology Officer at FCM Lab in Barcelona, part of the Flight Centre Travel Group.",
